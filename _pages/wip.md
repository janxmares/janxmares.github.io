### Finance and Wealth Inequality (with I. Hasan, R. Horvath)
Using a global sample, this paper investigates the determinants of wealth inequality capturing various economic, financial, political, institutional, and geographical indicators. Using instrumental variable Bayesian model averaging, it reveals that only a handful of indicators robustly matter, and finance plays a key role. It reports that while financial depth increases wealth inequality, efficiency and access to finance reduce inequality. In addition, redistribution and education are associated with lower inequality whereas wars and openness to international trade contribute to greater wealth inequality.

### Illicit Financial Flows and Trade Mispricing: Decomposing the Trade Reporting Gap (with A. Cobham, P. Jansky)
Trade mispricing is a real phenomenon, documented by numerous case studies, and identified as a major risk to international development. What is less clear is the scale of illicit financial outflows contained within any given pattern of mispricing, because there are multiple reasons for distortions in the data, and because individual methodologies may not allow clear separation of these. In this paper we review critically the existing methodologies to estimate trade mispricing. We find that some studies providing estimates for many countries are not reliable; while some studies using confidential customs data provide more robust findings that are unlikely to be easily replicated soon for many, especially low-income, countries. Both streams of literature are unsatisfactory since they do not provide us with an answer to the question of the scale of illicit financial flows due to trade mispricing, either globally or facing low-income countries in particular. The relatively novel focus of our review on decomposing the trade reporting gap into its component elements suggests a new methodological approach, which may combine robustness and broad coverage of countries. To this end, we present an explorative analysis using UN Comtrade data.

### Changes in the Czech Tax-benefit System: Long-run Effects (with V. Jacina)
We provide a methodological overview of the framework for assessing the long-run impact of the changes in tax-benefit system. The framework has three related building blocks. The first one is a microsimulation tool of the tax-benefit system which accounts for most of the taxes and benefits featured in the Czech welfare system. The second block employs the output of microsimulation tool to estimate consequent change in the labour supply of the individuals. It is a structural probit model which assigns probability of participation in the labour market to individuals based on their socio-demographic characteristics, wage, and non-labour income. The third block is a simple general equilibrium model where it is possible to model long-run macroeconomic relationships between gross domestic product, gross wage bill, net disposable income of households, and other macroeconomic indicators. Although we do not explicitly compute distributional impact of the simulated scenarios, the framework could be easily extended in this direction.
